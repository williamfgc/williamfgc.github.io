# Julia Language First Attempt

There are tons of posts about the Julia Language. I found myself interested as it's been a few times that I heard about the language in the past. Labeled as a programming language for "data science", "scientific computing" as being under development for a few years, I felt intrigued to try for one of my projects at work as it's been almost 2 years since [Julia reached a stable v1.0](https://julialang.org/blog/2018/08/one-point-zero/).

## My background and why it matters.
I have to disclose that I'm a long time user of Fortran, C++, C, I worked heavily with Java in the 2000s, and I have used Python (who hasn't?), R, Matlab in past projects. I must admit I'm far from being an expert in any language.

This is important to point out because people with different backgrounds could have completely different opinions. I'm pretty comfortable with some the features Julia "borrow" from some of these languages as I mentioned #TODO.  
 
## How did I come across Julia?
The first time I heard about Julia was around 2015-2016 when I was working at Intel Corporation. One of my colleagues mentioned as a really good language that is suitable for Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) applications. I must admit I didn't pay much attention since it was far from stable and I remember reading blogs and reddit post about the language. My first thoughts were to "give it time" as it's still "cooking".  

The second time a request came in one of the open source project for Julia bindings around 2018. It renew my interest, but given the lack of actual projects using Julia we declined. Around the same time I attended a talk by [Professor Alan Edelman](https://math.mit.edu/directory/profile.php?pid=63), one of the founder of Julia, at Oak Ridge National Laboratory. My first impression is that it's a really nice dynamic interface for numerical computing and linear algebra abstractions.

Fast forward to 2020      
 

## Setting up

My development desktop is Ubuntu 18, so I have to download and install Julia (v1.4) as there is no precompiled binaries. Not a big deal, I didn't miss `sudo apt-get install julia` (notice I still use `apt-get`). Still I installed julia under `/opt/julia/1.4/` and set up a symbolic link in `/usr/bin/julia` to `/opt/julia/1.4/bin/julia`.
