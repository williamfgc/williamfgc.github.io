# Julia Language First Attempt

There are tons of posts about the Julia Language. I found myself interested as it's been a few times that I heard about the language in the past. Labeled as a programming language for "data science", "scientific computing" as being under development for a few years, I felt intrigued to try for one of my projects as work as it's been almost 2 years since [Julia reached v1.0](https://julialang.org/blog/2018/08/one-point-zero/).

I have to disclose that I'm a long time user of Fortran, C++ and C due to the nature of my job, and I have used Python (who hasn't), R, Matlab in past projects, although I must admit I'm far from being an expert in dynamic languages.

## Setting up

My development desktop is Ubuntu 18, so I have to download and install Julia (v1.4) as there is no precompiled binaries. Not a big deal, I didn't miss `sudo apt-get install julia` (notice I still use `apt-get`). Still I installed julia under `/opt/julia/1.4/` and set up a symbolic link in `/usr/bin/julia` to `/opt/julia/1.4/bin/julia`. 


Work in progress...
